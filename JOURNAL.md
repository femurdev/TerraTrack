## 10/13/2025 - Prototyping, routing, discovering, and lighting things fire.  

This is to catch everyone up to the current state of things. I have mark one completed at this point but much to my dismay, it does not work. I have managed to burn it and can not afford any more components for the time being. 
## Here's a quick recap of what happened:
Learned on shape and created v1 (and technically v2, but that was small). 
### Shopping and Physics:
I ran some basic demos thing for my math. Look at what I have remaining from this step:

This translated to snooping arr round for parts shortly after, which is a headache to match steppers and motors.
### Onshape & Blender!!
Motor Connection v1 (3+ hours, I'm new to Onshape at this point):

Axel v1 (1 hour, getting better):

Gearbox v2 (2 hours again, multiple axies and offsets are hard for begining):
![Screenshot 2025-10-13 at 6.09.27 PM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjEwMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5ce81054dadda8320fc72e035bf6d243b317185d/Screenshot%202025-10-13%20at%206.09.27%E2%80%AFPM.png)

The gearbox took some hardware too.

Battery container v1 (4 hours, I used blender to try it out, don't reccommend):

### Fabrication
The printer broke like 4 times, at this point and I tried to fix the sucker for 6+ hours (not included here for obvious reasons.) (da Vinci Jr. XYZ printer from the cretaceous)
Off to the library to use their X1. Continued in CAD.
Took an hour or so of changing nozzles and filament + glusticking.

There were a few problems with this first batch. The most blaring is that the Axels repeatedly snapped. 

It was at some time at the 17-ish hour mark of this project when I started soldering my motor drivers and ESP32. This in of itself took two hours to find, set up, dismantle, and store.

I was spending the next hour-ish gluing the parts together when suddenly, _Sparks!_ _Smoke!_ _Panic!_. I don't have a photo of this but imagine ElectroBoom strumming his electric guitar. 

I discovered that a talent of mine that made this fire followed me here, complete idiocy. I had left the barreries in the capsule while I contined making other parts of the setup. Lickily, nothing was destroyed but this made me realize the need for a switch.

Jump to an hour later where I am found dismantling an old electronic board from I don't even know what. It had a toggle switch rated for 3 amps, good enough for me.

Stay tuned for part 2 of the catch up, we're only 4 days (only about 23 hours of which were on this project) into this mess at this point. Here's a recreation of the state of the bot at the end of this. Sorry about this taking so much time, I'm juggling cleaning and teaching my brothers about electronics as I build this. Its part of a larger team event so there are also numerous hours of discussion not mentioned here.
